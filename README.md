# Red Hat Access Insights Client

## Installing

On a RHEL7 box:

### Make sure the build dependencies are installed:

```bash
./tests/install-build-requirements
```

If the script fails, try to install the build requirements by hand.  If it fails because of
subscription-manager, try 'subscription-manager register --auto-attach', or just try yum without
subscription-manager.



### Next build it.

```bash
make clean install
```


### Next configure it.

1. Edit `/etc/insights-client/insights-client.conf`

Some things you might want to change:

1. User id, where YOUR_RHN_xxx is your RHN/Red Hat Portal username and password

    ```
    username=YOUR_RHN_USERNAME

    password=YOUR_RHN_PASSWORD
    ```


1. What server to use, where DEVEL_SERVER_AND_PORT is whatever development insights server you have set up.  If left default, the client will contact Red Hat's production server

    ```
    upload_url=http://DEVEL_SERVER_AND_PORT/r/insights/uploads

    collection_rules_url=http://DEVEL_SERVER_AND_PORT/v1/static/uploader.json

    gpg=False
    ```

1. Random logging stuff

    ```
    loglevel=DEBUG

    auto_config=False

    no_schedule=True
    ```

### Next run some tests:

```bash
insights-client --verbose --register

./tests/test-containers
./tests/test-containers "python ./insights_client/__init__.py"

./tests/test-new-specs
./tests/test-conditional-docker
```
